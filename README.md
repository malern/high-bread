# High Bread
Entry for [GitHubs Game Off 2018 game jam](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018).

Theme is *Hybrid*.

You are a dual wielding grappling hook slice of bread. Get yourself as high as possible!

# Controls

Click and hold mouse button to fire grappling hook. You have 2 grappling hooks that can be activated with the left and right mouse buttons.
